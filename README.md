## What is C\#?

C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

## List Down the differences between Public, Static, Void keywords.

1. STATIC: Is use to declare members of a type specific to that typeu.
2. VOID: State the method, but does NOT return any Value. 
3. PUBLIC: iIt is a access specifier,Which state the method of a class that can be accessed publicly.

##Define C\# and list the Features. 

1. Is Object oriented 
2. Type safe. 
3. Is a Managed language. 
4. Developed for all kind of software. 
5. Used by Millions. 
6. is part of .NET framework. 
### Features.
1. Easy to grap. 
2. Constructor-distructor clases. 
3. Uses Clases and objects. 
4. Is plataform independent. 

## Why to use C\#?

1. Scalable. 
2. Simple and fast. 
3. Cross lataform. 

## Types od comments in C\#. 

Single line:  //
Multy line: /* */ 
XML: ///

## Ilustrate the process of compilation.

1. Compilation of sorce code. 
2. Clubbing newly created node. 
3. CLR( Common Language Run Time).
4. Executing assembly.

## Access modifier in C\#. 

1. PUBLIC.
2. PRIVATE. 
3. INTERNAL. 
4. PROTECTED INTERNAL. 
5. PROTECTED.

## Differences between continue and Break Statements

| Brake | Continue |
| ---- | ---- | 
| Finish and Return What executed | Will continue with the code execution |

##Aproaches to pass Parameters to methods. 

1. VALUE parameters. 
2. REFERENCE parameters. 
3. OUPUT parameters 

## Differences Between FINALLY and FINALIZE blocks 

FINALLY is called after execution of TRY and CATCH blocks. 
FINALIZE is called jus before garbage colection. Clean up alteration and manage code, is automatically called. 

## What is MANAGE and UNMANAGE code. 

-MANAGE code: is executed by CLRm all the application code is dependent on .NET plattform. 
-UNMANAGE code: Executed by runtime apps. other estructure. the run time app deal with memory security and other executions. 

## What is a object?

Is a instance of a class, created by the "NEW", keyword in c\#.

##What is a class?
Is the blueprint of a object.
Define different funtionalities a object will have. 
"class" keyword. 

## What is a abstract class?

Is a class that objects can NOT be instaciated. 
Follow a single approach. 

## Define Sealed classes in C\#?

Seales classes are used to restrict inheritance. 
 -sealed modifiers
